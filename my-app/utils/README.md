# Utils

Motivation: why study and implement data structures and algorithms in the first place? Three main considerations that I came to the conclusion were:

1. Algorithms / DS underpin many of the technologies that a Software Engineer uses,
2. 
3. Refresher and extension of the Algorithms/DS course I took two years ago, and serves as a place to continiously tinker and experiment with new algorithms / DS as I learn them.
4. Apply some of the things I am currently learning from the book: "A philosophy of Software Development". These will be commented where appropriate as design decisions.

## Typescript

Why Typescript? I had recently read a book about Computer Systems, which mostly presented itself in C / assembly. However, this repository is for educational purposes so the benefits of being able to separate the ADT's as interfaces seems logical. In fact, the distinction between ADT and implementation does not seem to be highlighted well, as for example, an well-known ADT such as a Stack has multiple implementations (array, linked-listed, doubly linked-list), yet this distinction is vitally important when discussing an appropriate data structure and in particular what kind of operations are needed for a specific use case.

## Algorithms

## Data Structures

As a starting point, I will attempt to implement all the "Fundamental Abstract Data Types" and "Fundamental Data Structures" as listed out in Jeff Erickson's Algorithms book. 

ADT's can be implemented through Data Structures.

## ADT + DS

- [] Sequences
- [] Vector
- [] Set
- [] Stack / Queue
    - [] Array
    - [] Singly Linked List
    - [] Double Linked List
    - [] Dynamic Array
- [] Ordered Map
    - [] Hash Tables
- [] Priority Queues
    - [] Simple List 
    - [] Binary Min Heap
